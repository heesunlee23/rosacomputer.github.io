    <i> Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are mine. <br/>
    When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; <br/>
    when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you. (Isaiah 43:1) <br/>
